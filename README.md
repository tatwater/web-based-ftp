# Web-Based FTP


A Java implementation of a HTTP server with FTP web client

## Assignemnt:
##### Web-based FTP Server

Goal: For the final project, you are required to put your previous work together and make a web-based FTP server.

- You need to provide a web-based control UI using your HTTP server from project#3. You need to enable/disable your FTP server from the control webpage.

- The control page should let user input their ID and password (no need to validate password), port number. Then let the user to select enable/disable radio button, then apply (or OK) the change. The FTP server should work/stop working based on the configuration.

- Log the status of the FTP server (who and when login, and what operation he/she did).

 

Group: You are encouraged to work alone, but can form a group up to 3 people.

Grade: A total 100pts grade is based on the coding, functionality and performance.

Your code should be compiled without errors on Linux (warnings are OK). Code that cannot get passed by compiler will result a zero score.

Your code will follow good coding practice.

You code will be tested by standard ftp client on Windows/Linux. Performance will be evaluated by the test result.

Submission: Submit through Moodle. Deadline for submission is 5/9/2014 11:59pm EST for senior and 5/12/2014 11:59pm for other students. Late submission will result a penalty based on time (1ptr/hr).

You need to submit

- Your source code, together with a short README.txt description of how to compile your code, what files are included for this project. A build script would be better.

- If you have multiple files, you need to zip it before submission.
